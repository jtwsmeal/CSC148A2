# File System Tree Map Visualizer

This is the second assignment for CSC148 (Introduction to Computer Science) at the University of Toronto.

This application uses the Pygame library to display data, depending on the chosen mode.

The first type is a tree map of world populations, where each block's size is representative of a country's relative population.

The second is a tree map of your filesystem, which is a series of blocks of varying sizes which represent the relative sizes of files and directories in your file system.

To run the application, use `python treemap_visualiser.py <arg>`, where `<arg>` is `population` if you want to display the world population map, or `filesystem` if you want to display the file system map.
